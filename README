## Project Overview

This repository contains materials related to my Master’s dissertation, which focuses on the comparison between **predicted and observed genetic gains** for the trait *yield* in **polyclonal selection of ancient grapevine varieties** (*Vitis vinifera*).  

The study applied **linear mixed models** to multi-year yield data from different grapevine cultivars, with the following objectives:

- Estimate the genotypic variance component  
- Calculate broad-sense heritability  
- Predict genetic gains from polyclonal selection  
- Compare predicted gains with actual observed performance in subsequent plantations  

The results confirm the existence of **intra-varietal genetic variability** for yield, and show that most of the **observed gains fall within the predicted range**.
